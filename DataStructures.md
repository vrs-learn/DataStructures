## Big O Notation
Big O notation is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your program grow as input size grows.
For example:
- If running a loop on a list of "x" numbers to find an integer "n", I have to find the running time, I would calculate it as O(n)
    This values is derived as the for loop is running n times to identify the integer.
- Similarly if I am using Binary tree, if I have to calculate the number of iterations to reach the number, I would calculate the time taken as O(log n).
